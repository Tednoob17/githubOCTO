GitHub’s Office of the CTO (OCTO) investigates topics around the future of software development. We're excited to engage with the community of futurists, academics, and developers who are figuring out what software development will look like — not tomorrow, but next year, or next decade.

**OCTO is hosting a monthly speaker series!** We are featuring talks about the future of our craft and our industry, because the future of software development is as much about the people and teams that build as it is about the tools and techniques that they use.

# Join the discussion!

We've enabled GitHub Discussions on this repository so the community can engage with our speakers and with one another. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/github/githubOCTO/discussions">Discussions</a> tab to take part! There will be one thread for each speaker series session, but you're free to create additional topics.

We want to keep the discussions area a friendly and welcoming place for everyone taking part. Please respect the <a href="https://github.com/github/githubOCTO/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a> and be excellent to each other.
